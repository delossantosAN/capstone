            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">Here at PAWS Clinic and Supplies, we believe that a sound preventive health care regimen is the easiest and most effective way to keep your pets healthy and happy. Many diseases are easily preventable and most can be effectively treated and cured if detected early enough. However, if allowed to develop and progress unchecked, many diseases can quickly become difficult and expensive to treat, and in some cases incurable. Therefore, we strongly encourage every dog owner to take a proactive approach to preventive care.</p>

            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">Taking an active role in a dog wellness program begins with visits to the veterinarian for periodic physical exams. The physical exam is a comprehensive assessment of your dog's health. Because your dog cannot talk, we rely on the owners to provide us with key information to help us to assess your dog's health. Our veterinarians will ask you specific questions and your answers will help guide the examination to assess overall health and reveal developing health issues that can easily go unnoticed. Based on age, health status and pre-existing conditions, some dogs require a physical exam annually, and others semi-annually (every six months). During the physical exam, your veterinarian will review various aspects of your dog's health, including:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">After the physical exam, our veterinarian will discuss with you the findings and what, if anything, should be done to keep your dog in optimal health.</p>

                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Dental Care</h2>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Your pet's oral health is key for maintaining overall health. Dental disease is generally gradual and dogs adjust to living with oral pain and will not show signs they are uncomfortable. It is difficult for owners to know when their pet has dental disease or oral pain. For this reason, an important part of the physical exam is an oral exam. During this part of the exam, we will look at the teeth, tongue and oral cavity. The unfortunate reality is that periodontal disease affects most pets by age 4-5. Some of the possible dental conditions which can affect your pet include:</p>
                <div class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>
                        Malocclusion
                    </li>
                    <li>Tooth Loss/broken teeth</li>
                    <li>Gingivitis</li>
                    <li>Mouth Sores and Ulcers</li>
                    <li>Periodontal Disease</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            </div>
            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">This is why periodic and thorough dental care is essential to your pet's overall health. A thorough oral cleaning is something you should trust to your veterinarian every 6-12 months, but brushing can be performed on your canine companion in the comfort of your home. You can also help facilitate good dog health by providing toys and treats formulated to help strengthen and/or clean your pet's teeth and gums.</p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Vaccinations are a foundational and critically important part of the preventive care plan. The vaccinations we recommend will prevent diseases that, while not common, are still a serious threat to the health, longevity and quality of life of your pet. The only reason they are not common is because of the excellent vaccines we have to protect your pet and hopefully the rest of the animals that your pet will come into contact with. When owners stop vaccinating, we see a resurgence of these very deadly diseases. Generally, a vaccine protocol consists of a series of immunizations given to your pet as a puppy, boosters at one year and then periodically throughout its lifetime. </p>
            </div>
            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Although the rabies vaccine is the only vaccination currently required by law in most states, we strongly recommend making sure your canine companion is up to date on all of its core and non-core vaccinations. Your veterinarian can help determine a vaccination schedule as part of your pet health program based specifically on the lifestyle, geographic location and pre-existing medical conditions of your pet.</p>
